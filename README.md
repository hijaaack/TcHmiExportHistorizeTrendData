## TcHmiExportHistorizeTrendData
Export the historize trend data and saves it as a .json to the client.

The export function does not work in the embedded browser (LiveView) that is used inside Visual Studio. 

To test it, open the LivewView in your installed browser or publish the project and test it! :)
